# Face-Recoginition-Using-Machine-Learning
Face recognition is a rapidly growing field that uses machine learning techniques to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features. 

This technology is used in a wide range of applications, including security systems, photo tagging, and personal identification. 

Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets of facial images to learn the unique characteristics of each individual's face. Once trained, the algorithm can then accurately identify and verify individuals in real-time by comparing new images to the ones it has learned. 

Face recognition using machine learning is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to provide accurate and efficient identification while maintaining user privacy.
